/**
 * <p> This class represents a file or form item that was received within a
 * <code>multipart/form-data</code> POST request.
 *
 * <p> After retrieving an instance of this class from a {@link
 * org.apache.commons.fileupload.FileUpload FileUpload} instance (see
 * {@link org.apache.commons.fileupload.FileUpload
 * #parseRequest(javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest)}), you may
 * either request all contents of file at once using {@link #get()} or
 * request an {@link java.io.InputStream InputStream} with
 * {@link #getInputStream()} and process the file without attempting to load
 * it into memory, which may come handy with large files.
 *
 * <p> While this interface does not extend
 * <code>javax.activation.DataSource</code> per se (to avoid a seldom used
 * dependency), several of the defined methods are specifically defined with
 * the same signatures as methods in that interface. This allows an
 * implementation of this interface to also implement
 * <code>javax.activation.DataSource</code> with minimal additional work.
